## ✅ What This Project Enables

- 🔐 **Secure voter registration** using Aadhar authentication.
- 😎 **Face recognition** for voter identity confirmation.
- 🗳️ One-person-one-vote system with audit-proof records.
- 📈 Real-time vote tracking and live result display.
- 👨‍💼 Admin dashboard for managing elections, users, and candidates.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🔐 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
  Combination of Aadhar number, OTP (via Twilio), and facial recognition to verify voter identity.

- **🧑‍💼 Role-Based Access Control**  
  Distinct dashboards and access for **Admins** and **Voters**.

- **📊 Real-Time Results Monitoring**  
  Election results update live as votes are cast.

- **🔒 Tamper-Proof Voting**
